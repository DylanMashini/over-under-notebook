# Time Management + Project Planning (Iteration 1)

### Dylan Mashini

For the first iteration of our robot, we want to lay out a general schedule for completing all the parts of the robot. The robot can be broken down into a few subsystems. 

- Chassis
	- This is the most important. Right now we're planning on creating an X Drive, but it has to be very consistent and sturdy. This is the base for the rest of our robot, so we have to nail it. 
- Launcher
	- A good launcher is important to move Tri-Balls across the field. This is the first thing we're planning on building after the chassis is done. 
- Intake
	- The intake is the next most important thing. A good intake allows us to manipulate Tri-Balls with more precision than we otherwise could and also lets us get Tri-Balls into our launcher. 
- Endgame
	- Endgame is a good way to earn some points, but isn't critical for gameplay. Because of this, it is our last priority. 
- Programming
	- This has to happen along the way to make sure everything works, but it is the glue that holds all the subsystems together. Writing good code is going to be critical for a good season. 

Here's a Gantt chart, showing how we are planning to spend our time during the summer building. 

### Project Planning + Gantt Chart

This chart is a rough estimation of the timing we want to take for all the major subsystems. We made sure not to plan on having more than two subsystems being worked on at once because we didn’t want the team’s attention to be too split up. Balancing and budgeting our time is going to be really important for being successful this year. We really want to avoid working right before a competition, because that leads to lower quality, more error-prone work.

As you can see, we plan on getting the whole robot done before school gets back in. Between sports and rigorous schedules, our team is going to have significantly less time during the school year to work on it, so we want to have a robot done before school starts. Testing and practice can happen during the first month of school, and hopefully, we can go to a competition in September and see how we perform.
