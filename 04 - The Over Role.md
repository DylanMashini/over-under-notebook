x# The Over Role
### Ari Low
### June 3rd, 2023

For this year's game, we know that we need to be able to act as an Over. What this means, is that we need a way to launch Tri-Balls over the center goal. Based on previous games, we think that Catapult and Flywheel will be the most viable options. 

There are a few categories that we want to compare them in:

- Effective at launching the Tri-Ball
	- Whatever launching mechanism that we make must be able to launch a Tri-Ball across the field into our offensive zone. This must be consistent, which is going to be a challenge with the shape of the Tri-Balls. 
- Speed Launching the Tri-Ball
	- We must be able to launch a Tri-Ball at a high rate. This is essential for the first part of the game, which is introducing Tri-Balls from the match loads. Once you are done with that, you can move to a more defensive role in the game, which will be a large strategic benefit. 
- Easy to Build
	- This isn't as important, but it has to meet the time and resource constraints we have to build our robot. 
- Footprint on the robot
	- The launcher can't take up too much space, because we have to have room to mount an endgame and an intake afterwards. 

Let's compare the two options in each category

### Effective at launching the Tri-Ball

Right now, based on discussions on the VexForum, and some prototyping done by our team with a 3D-printed Tri-Ball (we couldn't wait for the game elements to arrive), it seems like the biggest concern with a flywheel launcher is going to be getting the Tri-Ball to launch consistently. We know that this is going to be a struggle with the shape of a Tri-Ball. Fortunately, catapults will fare much better in this category.

### Speed Launching the Tri-Ball
Launching tri-balls at a high rate is going to be essential this year, especially as we get later into the season. Teams that were able to launch 2-3 disks at once last year performed really well. This is significantly easier with a flywheel because you can just push multiple into the flywheel rapidly, assuming the motor has time to recover the RPM. This is more difficult with the wind-up of a Catapult. 

### Easy to Build
Both are viable for us to build in the time that we have, with the materials that we have, but catapults win in this category. This is because the amount of time I predict it would take to make a flywheel consistent would be much more time than it would take to make a catapult consistent. Considering that we haven't ever made a catapult, there is a significant learning curve, but I'm confident it will be easier to figure out than it would be to build a consistent flywheel. 

### Footprint on the Robot
The launcher needs to have a small footprint so we have space for other mechanisms. Flywheels likely will take up a smaller footprint, but this isn't a massively important factor, because we could work around either of them. 

## Decision Matrix
**Scores are 1-10**

| Criteria                     | Multiplier | Catapult Score | Flywheel Score |
|------------------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Effective at launching       | 4          | 9              | 5              |
| Speed Launching              | 3          | 6              | 8              |
| Easy to Build                | 2          | 8              | 6              |
| Footprint on the robot       | 1          | 7              | 9              |
| **Total**                    |            | **77**         | **65**         |

With this in mind, the winner is a catapult. I think it will be interesting, to learn to build a catapult for the first time. The Tri-Balls are huge, so it's going to be difficult to find a way to fit them onto a catapult arm.
