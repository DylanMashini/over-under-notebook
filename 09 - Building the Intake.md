### Mounting

To mount the intake, we have to put it at an angle. This is because we have to be able to pick Tri-Balls up from the floor, and elevate it to the height of our catapult. Mounting things at an arbitrary angle in vex is difficult, and to do this we bent a U-Chanel using a vice, and iterated until it was the correct angle. This was an effective mounting strategy, and has held up throughout testing. 

## Flex Wheels
We have an issue with flex wheels. We don't have any VersaHubs, but we need to use large Flex Wheels. Because we can't make any orders right now, we have to find an alternative to VersaHubs. 

One option is for us to 3D print VersaHubs until we are able to order them. This would not be competition legal, but we could replace them after we get them. I'm worried that we could forget to replace them, and end up with an illegal bot on competition day. For this reason, we are going to avoid using 3D printed parts if we can. That leaves us with vex legal parts that we can force into acting as a hub. Vex released an official KB post about this, and it looks like sprockets are going to be the most effective alternative to VersaHubs. To get the sprockets into the flex wheels, you had to stretch them with your hands, and it was really difficult, but now that it is on there, it won't be going anywhere. 

After establishing how we are going to mount it, and how we are going to use flex wheels with the resources that we have, we can start building the final assembly. This is made up of a 5.5W motor, two axles with a flex wheel each, and sprockets and gears to connect both axles. We will have two of those assemblies, both with their own motor, and they will be tensioned together under the robot.
