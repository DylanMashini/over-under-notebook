# Building the Intake

### Mounting

To mount the intake, we have to put it at an angle. This is because we have to be able to pick Tri-Balls up from the floor and elevate it to the height of our catapult. Mounting things at an arbitrary angle in vex is difficult, and to do this we bent a U-Chanel using a vice and iterated until it was the correct angle. This was an effective mounting strategy and has held up throughout testing. 

## Flex Wheels
We have an issue with flex wheels. We don't have any VersaHubs, but we need to use large Flex Wheels. Because we can't make any orders right now, we have to find an alternative to VersaHubs. 

One option is for us to 3D print VersaHubs until we can order them. This would not be competition legal, but we could replace them after we get them. I'm worried that we could forget to replace them, and end up with an illegal bot on competition day. For this reason, we are going to avoid using 3D-printed parts if we can. That leaves us with vex legal parts that we can force into acting as a hub. Vex released an official KB post about this, and it looks like sprockets are going to be the most effective alternative to VersaHubs. To get the sprockets into the flex wheels, you had to stretch them with your hands, and it was really difficult, but now that it is on there, it won't be going anywhere. 

After establishing how we are going to mount it, and how we are going to use flex wheels with the resources that we have, we can start building the final assembly. This is made up of a 5.5W motor, two axles with a flex wheel each, and sprockets and gears to connect both axles. We will have two of those assemblies, both with their motor, and they will be tensioned together under the robot. 


Here is a picture of the intake assembly. We had two of these that were identical, and they were mounted with the U channel bent at an angle to the robot.

After finishing the side assembly, we mounted it to the robot. We set it up to rest on a line of spacers that were used to reduce friction and make sure it moved smoothly. One issue we encountered was that the assemblies would pivot too far apart. This was solved using these "flags" that the flex wheel would hit if it went too far out.

These flags worked well, but we have to make sure to tighten them between rounds because they tend to come loose over time.
