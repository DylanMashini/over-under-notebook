# Preparing for Our First Comp of the Year
## Where are we?

There is about 4 days before our first competition. Last year our robot wouldn't be fully built at this point, but this year all the subsystems of our robot work well right now so we just have to practice driving. I feel like we're running behind where we wanted to be, but we're still doing alright. I hoped to be much more well practiced at driving, but I can practice 2 hours a day for the next 4 days, and I'll be much better. I also added LED's to the bottom of the robot for aesthetic this morning, and I think the robot looks complete. Here's a picture.

Everything looks very good, and it all works well. I think we can go at least 5-1 in our prelim rounds, and go into alliance selection pretty high up.
