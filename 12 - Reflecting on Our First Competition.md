# Reflecting on Our First Competition

## Prelim Rounds
Thankfully, all rounds were filmed and streamed to youtube, so we can review all of our rounds. 

### Prelim 1 (R9)
Our first prelim was R9. We won R9 80-34. We didn't use our catapult because our partner had a really consistent catapult and we were better at pushing. There was a slight issue with our chassis being underpowered, but we think it was because the battery started at 50%, and we didn't see that issue in rounds with a full battery. We acted as an under for the second half of the match, but also guarded our opponent's match load bar for the first part. What this meant is the other team wasn't able to get many tri-balls over. This strategy worked great, and we were good at defense because of how mobile our bot is. We used everything but our catapult this round, and our intake and drivetrain worked great. 

### Prelim 2 (R17)
This was certainly one of the worst Vex matches I've ever participated in. We were planning on being an over, because our partner didn't have any way to launch Tri-Balls. From after we launched our first 2-3 Tri-Balls, 2 of our drive motors weren't functional. We still don't know why this happened, but we couldn't move properly and were stuck. We spent the whole round trying to line up without drive motors for match loads. This didn't work, and we only got about half of the balls over. We don't know why this happened, or how to prevent it. The only way we fixed it was to unplug and plug them back in. This doesn't make sense because the light was on for both motors. We still don't know how to fix this, but we switched the motors after the comp to some of our backups. My theory is that the shaking from the catapult caused problems. Without functional motors, we lost 56-76. 

### Prelim 3 (R24)
This was a great round. We won 122-46. We acted as an under this round, because our partners had a faster catapult. We defended and pushed a ton of Tri-Balls under the goal. This gave us a huge point advantage at the end of the round. This round went almost perfectly, and we were confident we could go 5-1 at this point. 

### Prelim 4 (R30)
This round was another win. We won 94-83, but this was good because we acted as an over, and there was a defensive bot attempting to prevent us from launching Tri-Balls. We countered this defense well, and got 100% of the match loads across the bar. This was a big success of our robot. Our partner wasn't able to score a lot under the low goal, but we still won with our Tri-Balls in the offensive zone, and we were able to go across and score some under after we finished match loading. One thing that we needed to improve is the speed that we can match load, but that will be in the next iteration. 

### Prelim 5 (R35)
We also won this round. We won 70-27. To give our opponent's some credit, they did well considering one of the teams didn't show up. We acted as an over, and were able to match load all of the Tri-Balls. 
### Prelim 6 (R43)
This was a really bad round. At the beginning, we had the preload in our intake, and our catapult was up. We were planning on going to put it into the low goal first thing, but when we went to do that, I pressed the wrong button and ran the intake in the intake direction. This was really bad because it stuck the Tri-Ball under our catapult. Even worse, this counted as possession, so we were effectively disabled for the round, we slammed the bot against the wall trying to get it out, but it was stuck there. This caused us to lose the round 15-95. 

## Alliance Selection
After prelims, we stood at 12th place for alliance selection. This is ok, and we are guaranteed to be able to pick, but we were hoping to be in the top 5, so we weren't very happy about this. We found a team that would partner with us that had a very capable bot, but someone ahead of us picked them, so we were stuck with a bot that we had never worked with. 

## Prelim 1
We lost Prelim 1, and didn't progress any further. This was a bummer, but we were still hopeful to win a design or judges award. We created a good robot, and our poor performance was because of lack of driving skill and testing. This is a important lesson, and our team needs to keep in mind the amount of time it takes to learn how to properly operate a bot. 

## Awards
Thankfully, we won the design award. We're happy, and although it doesn't qualify us for states, it qualifies us for the US Open. It also confirms our efforts have paid off, and that we are doing our notebook right. 

## Planning for The Future

Right now we have to reflect on what our goals are, and the road to achieving them. Our primary goal for right now is to qualify to states ASAP. The next competition where all of our essential team members can go to is on January 6th. This is a long time away, so we can plan to do a near full rebuild. This competition is going to be more competitive because it is late in the season, but we should have a much more capable robot. We also are planning on going to the Score Showdown signature event during presidents day weekend, and the US Open. That plus (maybe) states, and (probably not but hopefully) worlds, means that we are going to have a eventful second half of our season.
