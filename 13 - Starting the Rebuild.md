# Starting the Rebuild
### Dylan Mashini
### November 10th, 2023

Throughout the first build, the team agreed that we shouldn't wrap ourselves up in what others were doing. Last year a common trend was us changing something to chase the "meta", and thinking that was the path to victory. If other successful teams were doing it, we assumed we needed to be too. This wasn't effective and ended up causing more stress and damage to our robot than it helped. Because of this, we agreed that we should trust our design and ideas, and commit to making our design the best that we could make it, only taking inspiration from others at the beginning of our design cycle. This worked out relatively well, and I'm happy with how our robot ended up, but in between design cycles is a great time to check to see what's working for the rest of the world, and take inspiration. 

Let's go over all the subsystems of the robot and evaluate their performance. 

### Drivetrain

#### The Good
The drivetrain was extremely effective at what we wanted. It was able to be very nimble, and the lack of force was made up for by being very quick and snappy. We never got pinned by a stronger bot, and we were still able to push Tri-Balls under the goal. 

#### The Bad
There was an issue with 2 of the motors, but we replaced them and don't anticipate this happening again in the future. More comprehensive testing is the only way I can think of avoiding something like this in the future. 

### Intake

#### The Good
The intake worked for what we needed it to, but was definitely a weak point for our robot. It allowed us to get our preloads into the low goal really quickly, and we used it to move balls across the field throughout the rounds. 

#### The Bad
The intake caused a massive problem that lost us a round. It sucked a Tri-Ball underneath the catapult. This was the driver's fault (me). I think I accidentally pressed the intake button instead of the outtake button, but now that we know, we should design our robot to make this impossible. Another issue was when it was holding a Tri-Ball and moving around, it tended to fall out the top. Because of these issues, and overall not being satisfied with the design, we are scrapping this intake and starting from scratch. I don't know what this new intake is going to look like yet, but right now I think that it will probably be decoupled from the catapult because right now it looks like gameplay doesn't require intake to catapult very often. 

### Catapult

#### The Good
The catapult was pretty good and worked throughout the competition. The slip gear held up, and our catapult remained pretty consistent throughout. We did match loads in about half of our rounds, and we were able to get ~90% of Tri-Balls across the bar. 

#### The Bad
Our catapult was massively inefficient. It used 12 bands (which is a lot of power) to just barely get Tri-Balls across the bar. Catapults aren't as good as punchers in this game, and now we know that. Also, the catapult took a long time for a cycle, making it take a long time for us to get all our match loads across. All things considered, I'm happy with it because it worked, but there is a lot of room for improvement.

## Time Management + Project Planning
Here's a Gantt chart showing how we plan to spend our next couple of months. We plan to stick to the same type of 2-month design cycle we tried to use for the first iteration because that seemed to work well. Our first competition is going to be at the beginning of January, so we want the robot to be done before the end of December.
