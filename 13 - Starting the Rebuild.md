# Starting the Rebuild

Throughout the first build, the team agreed that we shouldn't wrap ourselves up in what others were doing. Last year a common trend was us changing something to chase the "meta", and thinking that was the path to victory. If other successful teams were doing it, we assumed we needed to be too. This wasn't effective, and ended up causing more stress and damage to our robot than it helped. Because of this, we agreed that we should trust our design and ideas, and commit to making our design the best that we could make it, only taking inspiration from others at the beginning of our design. This worked out relatively well, and I'm happy with how our robot ended up, but in between design cycles is a great time to check to see what's working for the rest of the world, and take inspiration. 

Let's go over all the subsystems of the robot and evaluate their performance. 

### Drivetrain

#### The Good
The drivetrain was extremely effective at what we wanted. It was able to be very nible
#### The Bad
### Intake

### Catapult
