# Designing The Wings
## Dylan Mashini

This iteration, we decided that we wanted to have wings on our robot. This is because we want to be able to push more effectively, and descore. Last competition we didn't have wings, and we just used the flat end of our X Drive chassis to score, but I think by skipping wings we left a lot of points on the table. Initially, when brainstorming the wings, we thought we would utilize the flat end of the X Drive to be the center pusher for the wings, but this wasn't feasible because we would have to store the wings on the intake and catapult side of the robot. Instead, the pusher is going to be below the catapult. This is good for a couple of reasons:
- Allows us to push with a full 36" surface
- Prevents Tri-Balls from getting stuck under the slip gear
- Allows us to store the wings on the flat ends of the robot where there isn't anything in the way

We are going to use pneumatics to actuate the wings. This has a set of its own challenges, but I think we can work through it.
