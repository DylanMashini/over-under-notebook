# Building The Puncher
### Ari Low

Building the puncher was a pretty simple task because it was already designed in CAD. There are a few steps I had to do. 

- Remove the Catapult Arm
- Remove the Basket
- Cut the Catapult Arm
- Add a plate connecting the two C Channels
- Add a standoff that actually "punches" the Tri-Ball
- Reassemble everything

This only took about an hour and was a pretty painless conversion. In my testing, we are actually able to get about 1 out of every six shots from the match-loading area inside of the goal, and the rest pile up in front of the goal. This is perfect because we can just go across the field and push them in. 

This is a pretty short entry because most of the work was done in the design/CAD stage. Overall, I think this is a very small change that is going to have a massive impact on our robot.
