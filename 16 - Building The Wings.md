# Building The Wings

To build the wings, I just have to copy what we have in the CAD model and add polycarbonate. This polycarb is going to be what actually pushes the Tri-Balls. 

### C Chanels

For this, I used all Aluminum, because we want to keep our weight down for endgame. We have some ambitious endgame plans, so we want to save weight wherever we can.
