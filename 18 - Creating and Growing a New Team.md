# Creating and Growing a New Team

This type of entry probably doesn't belong in the engineering notebook, but I find it important to document, as it is taking up a significant amount of our team's time, and I think it can offer insight into our team's leadership style and the structure that we've established for robotics at Pope HS. 

At our school, we have 3 presidents of robotics, and we all started as freshmen. The previous leadership was inactive, with Pope HS only going to one competition in all of its history. We had one V5 kit, but it was still in the box and hadn't been opened yet. The engineering teacher asked us to help him clean up the back room, and in return he let us mess with the new shiny V5 kit. Through this, we discovered the crazy stuff people built online, and how interesting competition robotics can be. The next year (Spin Up), we decided to compete as a school and got all the necessary supplies. In the same year, we started hosting in-school "challenges" that let more people get involved in robotics at our school. These students who wanted to attend weekly robotics meetings but not compete built robots for small challenges at the school using old vex cortex gear, and it was overall a success, with our robotics club gaining 40 members in the first few weeks of it running. This meant that demand for the competition team went up. We had a cap of 12 students on it, because any more would be really overwhelming, and we had a surplus of talented students wanting to compete.

Because of this, we attempted to start another robotics team, but we needed the funds to do that. We couldn't get any grants or funding to start another team until now, but we just got a few thousand to buy materials. This enables us to start creating a team "B". Rather than waiting until next season for them to begin competing, we want them to go to one competition this year. Even though it might not be possible for them to build a highly competitive robot in that time, it will still allow them to gain competitive robotics experience. There's an urgency for us to get as many people going with robotics as possible because all of leadership is in our Junior year, so we want to build a good foundation before we graduate. If we aren't careful, the program we built dies with us. In 2025, we graduate, and our engineering teacher retires, so we need to build some serious momentum with underclassmen.
