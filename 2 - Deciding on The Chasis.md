# 2 - Deciding on The Chasis
## Form Factor

The type of chassis for this year was a major decision for our team. We've wanted to do a X drive for about a year now, but we didn't know if it was ideal for this year's game. If we didn't chose a X drive, we would've used a traditional tank drive (like we did last year).

### X Drive

##### Pros:
- A X drive likely will allow us to be more nimble, and have a better offense
- Field Centered Control would be ideal with a robot that has a intake on the front and a launching mechanism on the back
- Ability to strafe is ideal in a game where the field is split into 2
- X drives look cool

##### Cons:
- We can be pushed around more easily and will be prone to defense
- Mounting an intake, launcher, and a endgame mechanism will be difficult with an X drive
- Likely direct drive meaning we have less control over the gear ratio and won't be able to distribute load across motors
- Due to the likely non symmetrical nature of our ideas for endgame, driving straight may be an issue because of [center of gravity issues](https://www.vexforum.com/t/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-x-drive-for-in-the-zone/41353/5)
- Complexity of Code
- Harder to get over the bar

### Tank Drive

##### Pros:
- Robust and Simple which makes troubleshooting and design easier
- Increased Traction will allow us to be defensive
- Design Flexibility allows us to mount sub assemblies easier
- Simplicity of Code
- Already have experience deciding 
- Easier to get over the bar

##### Cons:
- Limited Maneuverability makes efficient operation on the field more difficult
- Larger Footprint
- Limited Aesthetic Appeal (Doesn't look Cool)

### Decision
We ultimately decided to build a X drive because of the competitive advantage that we could gain from being able to be more nimble on the field. I predict that this year's meta will be a lot less focused on brute force and more on agility because the tasks require you to move quickly and efficiently within a small space compared to last year. Right now it seems like each match will have an "Over" bot and an "Under" bot that stay on their respective side and either toss over tri-balls or push them under the goal. This means that you don't need to cover very much ground throughout
