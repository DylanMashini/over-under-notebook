# Scouting
## Gavin Huey

To be prepared for the upcoming competition, we wanted to know how challenging our competition was. This is the first time our team has "scouted" before an event, and we decided to do this for a few reasons. 

First, if we could know what the strongest teams were, we could go into the competition knowing who would be a good candidate for alliance selection. Our decision is going to be mostly made up of how teams are doing during the competition, but it isn't a bad idea to have an idea of who we expect to do well. 

Second, we wanted to put our minds at ease. There are some powerhouse teams in Georgia that we don't have a chance of beating, because they have large experienced teams with full time coaches assisting them in the design process. We've gone up against a few of them at the past, and wanted to see if there was anything like that at our upcoming competition. Fortunately, we didn't see anything like this. 

To scout, we decided to take advantage of RobotEvent's download spreadsheet feature. This allowed us to download an excel sheet that already had all of the teams on it. 


### Conclusion
After scouting, I feel a lot more confident about our chances. Our goal is to qualify for states, and there are two spots available. These are through the (1) Excellence Award, and the (2) Tournament Champions. Although I think we have a chance of securing one of those three, the qualification criteria says that if a out of state team wins any of them, the states qualification goes to the highest on the skills list. This is really beneficial for us, because more then half of the teams competing are based in Tennessee. This also tells us that we have to prioritize skills. We have never had a autonomous skills routine, but we definitely need one for this upcoming competition.
