# Preparing For The Competition

There are a few things that need to be done before the competition to make sure that we pass inspection, and are prepared for any maintenance that our robot needs. 

One of the things we haven't paid much attention to while building the second iteration of our robot is polycarbonate usage. Before inspection, we want to make sure we didn't use too much. Per the game manual, all of our polycarbonate needs to fit within a 12" by 24" sheet. To figure this out, we measured 24 inches on a table and placed a measuring tape to see where 12 inches was. Instead of removing all the polycarbonate from our robot, we just made cutouts. This is how it fits within the space.

There is plenty of room to spare, so we don't have to worry about that. We're going to bring the cutouts of paper to the competition just in case any judge asks for verification that we are within the constraints. 

Another thing to consider before the competition is whether or not we're in size. Last year, we had to do modifications at a competition to get our robot within size. This year, we intentionally left an extra inch of wiggle room, to prevent anything like that from happening again. We double-checked, and our largest dimension was 17.25", leaving us with some extra wiggle room. 

Another thing we need to do before the competition is make sure that we have backups for parts that have a high chance of failing. For example, the plate between the arms on the puncher tends to bend after a lot of usage, so we need to cut a few of that same plate for us to use. This should prevent us from having to do too much work at the competition itself. 

Overall, I feel pretty prepared for the competition. We were supposed to be much more prepared by now, but the failed lift set us back by a couple of weeks.
