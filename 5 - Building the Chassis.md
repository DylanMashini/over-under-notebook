# Building the Chassis
### Ari Low

The chassis design looks good, and it's time to start building the chassis. Right now, there are a few things we know we need that aren't included in the CAD. 

- Odometry Wheels
- Brain Mounting
- Possible Mounting point for Air Tank

Right now I have a general idea of where these things should go, but I'll have to iterate on it to make sure that it works. 

## Building

I started by creating the inner and outer tracks of the X drive. These were pretty straightforward, but midway through we ran out of $45^\circ$ gussets. To continue being productive, I attached all 4 C Chanels together before adding the angled ends. This ended up making things more difficult when I had to put in the motors, axles, and wheels. Here's a render of what the bot looked like after attaching the 4 C Chanels.
