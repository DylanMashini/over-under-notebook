# Designing a Intake

## The End Of CAD

Although we have had a lot of success designing with CAD, a more iterative real world approach is going to serve us better for designing the intake. This is for a few reasons, but the most significant is mounting the intake at an angle. This is going to require bending Structural Pieces, which is difficult to model in Fusion. CAD really excels at critical and complex systems like the Drivetrain that everything else is going to be built on top of. It is less beneficial for smaller subsystems that can be tuned and iterated on more easily in the real world. I am disappointed about losing the ability to make renders of every part that we talk about, but it is a tradeoff that is worth it. 

## How is the intake going to work?
