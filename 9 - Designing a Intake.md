# Designing a Intake

## The End Of CAD

Although we have had a lot of success designing with CAD, a more iterative real world approach is going to serve us better for designing the intake. This is for a few reasons, but the most significant is mounting the intake at an angle. This is going to require bending Structural Pieces, which is difficult to model in Fusion. CAD really excels at critical and complex systems like the Drivetrain that everything else is going to be built on top of. It is less beneficial for smaller subsystems that can be tuned and iterated on more easily in the real world. I am disappointed about losing the ability to make renders of every part that we talk about, but it is a tradeoff that is worth it. 

## Design Requirements

- Intake Tri-Balls into Catapult
- Run in reverse to place Tri-Balls into low goal
- Fit into size requirements
- Use minimal Polycarbonate because of material constraints
- Maximum of 11W of motor usage (No more then 1 big motor or 2 Small motors)

### Motors
This is a good time to discuss the new motor rules. I was surprised to see that the 5.5W work-cell motors were added to the list of competition legal parts. These are going to offer the ability to make mechanisms simpler because instead of having to devise your own powertrain, you can just have 2 separate sources of power.  Right now, we only have the 11W motors, but we have a surplus of them, and once the school year begins we can order 5.5W motors. So we are going to prototype with above the legal wattage, and replace motors once we are able to get 5.5W motors. To make sure that 5.5W motors are strong enough, we will only run the 11W motors at a max of 50%. 

## Designing It

Right now, we have to decide between a horizontal and a vertical intake. What I'm defining as a horizontal intake is an intake with wheels that are parallel(ish) to the ground. A vertical intake has wheels at a $90^\circ$ angle to the ground. This type of intake (from Spin Up) would be considered a vertical intake based on my terminology.

There are a few categories we used to judge our intake:

- Consistently Intake
	- The intake must be able to consistently intake Tri-Balls. This is important because of the strange shape of the 
- Footprint
	- The intake needs to fit into the existing build and allow for the addition of a endgame
- Easy to Build
	- The intake needs to be easy enough for us to build. We're already almost halfway through summer, and we want to finish everything except for endgame before school starts
- Place in Low Goals
	- We envision an intake with a secondary function of placing Tri-Balls into the low goals. 
- Intake into existing catapult design
	- The Tri-Balls should consistently land in the existing hardware for our catapult. 

We considered horizontal vs vertical intake across these criteria and determined:
### Consistently Intake
Both have the ability to consistently intake, although I would say that a horizontal intake will likely be much easier to build where it can consistently intake. This is because with a vertical intake, we likely would need a bottom and top set of wheels. This means that it will have to be elevated off the ground, and I don't see how that could work well for us.

### Footprint
The footprint is going to be similar either way. I don't see any significant difference between horizontal or vertical intake. 

### Easy to Build 
I don't see how
